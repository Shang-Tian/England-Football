# England-Football
This study uses the International Football Results database（link：https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=shootouts.csv）to analyze England’s performance trends, outcomes against European powerhouses, and results across competition types. Through statistical analysis and visualization, it identifies key patterns and provides insights into factors influencing England's success in international football.

The aim of this research is to analyze the performance of the England national football team across various international tournaments. England's rich footballing history includes a historic World Cup victory in 1966, but their performance has fluctuated significantly since, reaching the semi-finals only once (1990) and the finals of major tournaments just once (2020 UEFA Euro). This study examines performance trends over time, comparing results in competitive tournaments versus friendlies and analyzing outcomes against footballing powers like Brazil, Germany, and France. Using historical data from the International Football Results database, this research highlights the factors influencing England’s successes and challenges, providing insights into how tournament type and opposition strength impact their results.

This study will complete the answers to three questions：1.	What trends can be identified in England's football performance over the years? 2.How does England perform when facing traditional European powerhouses in competitive versus friendly matches? 3.	How does England perform in different types of competitions?

Draw conclusions after analyzing data and graphs：
RQ1: What trends can be identified in England's football performance over the years? The analysis reveals significant fluctuations in England’s football performance over time. Peaks, such as the 1966 World Cup victory, highlight moments of success, while declines in the 1980s and 1990s suggest challenges in maintaining consistent performance. Recent trends, however, indicate signs of improvement, pointing towards possible adaptation and progress in recent decades.
RQ2: How does England perform when facing traditional European powerhouses in competitive versus friendly matches? England’s performance against Germany, France, Spain, and Italy demonstrates stark differences between competitive and friendly matches. While competitive games show balanced win, draw, and loss rates, friendlies reveal a higher win percentage and fewer losses, suggesting England performs better in less pressured environments but may lack readiness for high-stakes scenarios.
RQ3: How does England perform in different types of competitions? The results across six competition types show distinct patterns. England exhibits strong performances in qualification rounds, with high win rates in both the FIFA World Cup Qualification and UEFA Euro Qualification. In contrast, their win rates in the final stages of the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro are lower, reflecting the greater challenges posed by stronger opponents. Additionally, England’s dominance in the British Home Championship is evident from its higher win rate compared to friendlies, indicating superior performance in regional settings.

Further analysis led to the conclusion:
RQ1: The trends align with findings from previous studies, such as Taylor (2006) and Ng et al. (2017), which emphasize the historical impact of changing tactical styles and competition dynamics on England’s performance. The observed peaks, like the 1966 World Cup victory, correlate with moments when England successfully adapted to global football trends. In contrast, declines during the 1980s and 1990s reflect criticisms from Wilson (2018) and Hornby (2010), who argue that England was slow to modernize its football philosophy during these decades. The recent upward trend suggests progress, potentially driven by increased investment in youth development and managerial changes.
RQ2: England’s contrasting performance in competitive and friendly matches supports the findings of Smith et al. (2019), who note that friendlies often serve as platforms for experimentation. However, England’s relatively conservative approach in friendlies contrasts with teams like Japan under Hajime Moriyasu, who used such matches to successfully test new formations and strategies (Moriyasu et al., 2021). Wilson (2018) highlights how a lack of tactical innovation has historically limited England’s success in high stakes matches, suggesting that friendlies could be better utilized for preparation.
RQ3: The patterns observed across different competitions align with the broader literature. High win rates in qualification stages support Ng et al. (2017)’s argument that England excels against weaker opponents. However, the lower win rates in the UEFA Euro compared to the FIFA World Cup highlight challenges in facing tactically adept European teams, consistent with Hornby (2010). The dominance in the British Home Championship further underscores England’s historical strength in regional competitions, reflecting Smith et al. (2019)’s observation that familiarity with opponents often enhances performance. These results underline England’s strengths and weaknesses in adapting to varying competition levels and settings.
