This study uses the International Football Results database（link：https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=shootouts.csv）to analyze England’s performance trends, outcomes against European powerhouses, and results across competition types. Through statistical analysis and visualization, it identifies key patterns and provides insights into factors influencing England's success in international football.

The aim of this research is to analyze the performance of the England national football team across various international tournaments. England's rich footballing history includes a historic World Cup victory in 1966, but their performance has fluctuated significantly since, reaching the semi-finals only once (1990) and the finals of major tournaments just once (2020 UEFA Euro). This study examines performance trends over time, comparing results in competitive tournaments versus friendlies and analyzing outcomes against footballing powers like Brazil, Germany, and France. Using historical data from the International Football Results database, this research highlights the factors influencing England’s successes and challenges, providing insights into how tournament type and opposition strength impact their results.
