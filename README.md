# England-Football
This study uses the International Football Results database（link：https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=shootouts.csv）to analyze England’s performance trends, outcomes against European powerhouses, and results across competition types. Through statistical analysis and visualization, it identifies key patterns and provides insights into factors influencing England's success in international football.

The aim of this research is to explore the performance of the England national football team across three key dimensions to provide a comprehensive understanding of their results in international football. This study first seeks to identify patterns in England’s results, considering historical fluctuations such as their decline in the 1980s and 1990s and recovery in the 2000s and 2010s, including their semi-final appearance in the 2018 World Cup (Fan et al., 2023). Second, it examines England’s performance against traditional European powerhouses comparing competitive tournaments with friendly matches to evaluate how the level of stakes influences outcomes (Li & Mateos, 2022). Lastly, the research analyzes performance discrepancies between competitive tournaments and friendlies, highlighting that England’s win rates are significantly higher in the latter, reflecting challenges in sustaining consistent results under high-pressure conditions (Omondi-Ochieng, 2015). By addressing these dimensions, the study aims to uncover factors influencing England’s footballing success and challenges.

This study will complete the answers to three questions：1.	What trends can be identified in England's football performance over the years? 2.How does England perform when facing traditional European powerhouses in competitive versus friendly matches? 3.	How does England perform in different types of competitions?

Draw conclusions after analyzing data and graphs：
RQ1: What trends can be identified in England's football performance over the years? The analysis reveals significant fluctuations in England’s football performance over time. Peaks, such as the 1966 World Cup victory, highlight moments of success, while declines in the 1980s and 1990s suggest challenges in maintaining consistent performance. Recent trends, however, indicate signs of improvement, pointing towards possible adaptation and progress in recent decades.
RQ2: How does England perform when facing traditional European powerhouses in competitive versus friendly matches? England’s performance against Germany, France, Spain, and Italy demonstrates stark differences between competitive and friendly matches. While competitive games show balanced win, draw, and loss rates, friendlies reveal a higher win percentage and fewer losses, suggesting England performs better in less pressured environments but may lack readiness for high-stakes scenarios.
RQ3: How does England perform in different types of competitions? The results across six competition types show distinct patterns. England exhibits strong performances in qualification rounds, with high win rates in both the FIFA World Cup Qualification and UEFA Euro Qualification. In contrast, their win rates in the final stages of the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro are lower, reflecting the greater challenges posed by stronger opponents. Additionally, England’s dominance in the British Home Championship is evident from its higher win rate compared to friendlies, indicating superior performance in regional settings.

Further analysis led to the conclusion:
RQ1: The trends align with findings from previous studies, such as Carter (2006) and Orejan (2011), which emphasize the historical impact of changing tactical styles and competition dynamics on England’s performance. The observed peaks, like the 1966 World Cup victory, correlate with moments when England successfully adapted to evolving football tactics and global trends. Conversely, declines during the 1980s and 1990s reflect criticisms that England was slow to modernize its approach, both tactically and structurally, during these decades (Orejan, 2011). Recent improvements suggest progress driven by significant investments in youth development and strategic managerial changes, positioning England more competitively on the global stage.
RQ2: England’s contrasting performance in competitive and friendly matches aligns with findings from Rein et al. (2021), who emphasize that friendlies often provide a platform for tactical experimentation and development. However, England’s relatively conservative approach in these matches contrasts with examples like Portugal and Japan, where friendlies have been effectively used to test innovative formations and pressing strategies (Coutinho et al., 2020). By better utilizing friendlies, England could enhance preparation and adaptability for competitive matches.
RQ3: The patterns observed across different competitions align with broader findings. England's high win rates in qualification stages support Carmichael et al.'s (2000) conclusion that teams often excel against weaker opponents due to reduced tactical and psychological challenges. However, the lower win rates in the UEFA European Championship compared to the FIFA World Cup highlight challenges when facing stronger, tactically advanced European teams, consistent with Liu et al. (2016), who emphasize the role of tactical adaptability in high-level competitions. Additionally, England’s historical dominance in regional competitions, such as the British Home Championship, aligns with studies highlighting the advantage of familiarity with opponents and competition formats (Pollard & Gómez, 2014). These results underline England's strengths and weaknesses in adapting to varying competition levels and contexts.
